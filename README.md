# Clalit_Zeev

Running the project:
--------------------
For running, use Visual Studio 2022.


General notes:
--------------
There are several things I wanted to do but due to time constraints didn't make it.

Client
1. Home component change to functional component (call the service from useEffect)
2. API call results validation.
3. Nicer UI (css).
4. API url should be in process.env.REACT_APP file.
5. No negative exchange rates message.

Server
1. Use XmlSerilaizer and LinQ to Xml.
2. Change template to web api.
3. n-Tier like structure even though this is a small project.


Future todos:
-------------
1) custom exceptions
2) cache
3) mock api testing
4) failure test cases

# Clalit_Zeev

Running the project:
--------------------
For running, use Visual Studio 2022.


General notes:
--------------
There are several things I wanted to do but due to time constraints didn't make it.

Client
Nicer UI (css).

Server
1. Use XmlSerilaizer and LinQ to Xml.
2. n-Tier like structure even though this is a small project.


Future todos:
-------------
1) custom exceptions
2) cache
3) mock api testing
4) failure test cases

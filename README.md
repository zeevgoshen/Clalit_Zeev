Running the project:
--------------------
For running, use Visual Studio 2022.


General notes:
--------------
There are several things I wanted to do but due to time constraints didn't make it.

Client
1. Home component change to functional component.
2. API call results validation.
3. Remove not in use Router files.

Server
1. Use XmlSerilaizer for a more clear conversion.
2. Change template to web api.


Future todos:
-------------
1) custom exceptions
2) cache
3) mock api testing

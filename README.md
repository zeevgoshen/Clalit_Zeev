Running the project:
--------------------
For running, use Visual Studio 2022.


General notes:
--------------
There are several things I wanted to do but due to time constraints didn't make it.

Client
1. Home controller change to functional component.
2. API result validation.

Server
1. Use XmlSerilaizer for a more clear conversion.
2. Change template to web api.


Future todos:
-------------
1) custom exceptions
2) cache
